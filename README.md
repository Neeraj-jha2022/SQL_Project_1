Covid-19 Pandemic: A Comprehensive Data Analysis with SQL & Tableau
By Neeraj Jha

COVID-19 Data Analysis Using SQL

Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic was a once-in-a-lifetime global crisis that claimed countless lives and affected the world on an unprecedented scale. This project embarks on an analytical journey to uncover insights into the pandemic's impact across the globe.

Dataset Overview
The analysis uses datasets from the World Health Organization (WHO), focusing on key metrics such as total cases, death counts, infection rates, vaccination rollouts, and the virus's impact across various continents.

Key Questions Addressed
What percentage of the global population was vaccinated?
What are the death counts across continents?
Which continent had the highest death count relative to its population?
Which countries had the highest infection rates compared to their population?
What percentage of the population was infected globally?
What are the total cases versus total deaths in Nigeria?
Dataset Details
COVID-19 Deaths Table: The table (CovidDeaths) comprises 26 columns and 81,060 rows.
COVID-19 Vaccinations Table: The table (CovidVaccinations) contains 37 columns and 85,171 rows.
Data Selection for Analysis
The analysis focuses on selecting relevant fields for insights:


Key Findings
1. Total Cases vs. Total Deaths in Nigeria
This analysis explored the likelihood of dying from COVID-19 if infected in Nigeria.
Insight:
As of April 30, 2021, Nigeria recorded 165,110 total cases and 2,063 deaths, translating to a death rate of approximately 1.25%.
Compared to the global average death rate of 2%, Nigeria's lower rate may be attributed to factors such as a younger population and less severe virus strains.

2. Total Cases vs. Population Percentage Infected
This query analyzed the percentage of a country's population infected with COVID-19.
Insight:
Countries like Andorra reported an infection rate of 17%, significantly higher than others.
In Nigeria, only 0.08% of the population was infected, potentially indicating limited testing and underreporting.


4. Countries with the Highest Infection Rate Relative to Population
This analysis identified countries with the highest infection rates compared to their population size.
Insight:
The United States recorded the highest death count, reflecting both its large population and the significant spread of the virus.


5. Continent-wise Death Count
This analysis revealed which continents suffered the highest death counts.
Insight:

North America had the highest death count, followed by South America, highlighting the severe toll of the pandemic in these regions.


6. Global COVID-19 Numbers
This query calculated the global death rate as a percentage of total cases.
Insight:

Globally, the death rate stood at approximately 2.11%.


7. Vaccination Rollout Analysis
This analysis examined the percentage of the population vaccinated across countries.
Insight:

Developed countries with higher vaccination rates experienced a slower rise in new cases, highlighting the critical role of vaccines in controlling the pandemic.

3. Countries with the Highest Infection Rate Relative to Population
This analysis identified countries with the highest infection rates compared to their population size.
Insight:
Smaller countries like Andorra had disproportionately high infection rates due to their dense populations.

4. Countries with the Highest Death Count per Population
This query highlighted the countries with the highest death counts relative to their populations.
Insight:
The United States recorded the highest death count, reflecting both its large population and the significant spread of the virus.

6. Continent-wise Death Count
This analysis revealed which continents suffered the highest death counts.

Recommendations

Accelerate Vaccine Distribution in Developing Nations: Prioritize vaccine rollout in low-income countries to control virus spread.
Improve Testing and Reporting: Invest in healthcare infrastructure to enhance data accuracy and manage future pandemics.
Strengthen Public Health Communication: Educate populations on preventative measures and vaccination benefits.
Enhance Pandemic Preparedness: Develop comprehensive plans to mitigate healthcare system overloads.
Foster Global Collaboration: Support cross-border efforts to share resources and data during global crises.
